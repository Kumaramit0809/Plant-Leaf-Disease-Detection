ðŸŒ¿ Plant Leaf Disease Detection Using CNN
A deep learning-based web app that detects diseases in plant leaves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Users can upload a leaf image and get instant predictions with disease name and confidence score.

ðŸš€ Features
Detects multiple crop diseases (e.g., tomato, potato, pepper)

Built with TensorFlow, Keras, Flask
Real-time prediction with simple UI

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Python, Flask, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

ðŸ§  How It Works
Upload a leaf image.

The CNN model analyzes the image.

Disease name and confidence score are shown.
